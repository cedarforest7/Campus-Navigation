# Campus-Navigation
Campus Navigation Web App
July 2018
I developed the backend of a web mapping application of UC Berkeley based on real-world mapping data from Open Street Map dataset. The navigation features such as zooming in/out and dragging the map, finding the shortest route when double clicking the starting and destination points, and displaying the turn-by-turn sequence of navigation instructions were implemented using Java with Apache Maven as its build system.
